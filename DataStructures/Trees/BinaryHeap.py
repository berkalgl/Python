# Binary Heap
# the beauty of the binary heaps is that they take up the least amount of space possible 
# because its always left to right insertion
# thats why they dont have unbalanced concept
# they preserve order insertion
# the parent is always greater then children
# thats why they are useful for priority queues which's each element has priority
# priority queues like queue in the nightclub with vips coming because vips have higher priority

# Max Heap is a tree than it goes to lower values from higher values
#              101
#        72           33
#     2     45     5      1     

# min heap is the opposite

# lookup O(n)
# insert O(logN)
# delete O(logN)

# better than O(n)   Slow lookup
# priority
# flexible Size
# fast insert

#They have findMax and findMin which are fast
