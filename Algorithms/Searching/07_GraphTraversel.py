# BFS --> Shortest path   example; Recommendation engines, peer to peer networks, even Google Maps, Facebook friend requests 
# Instagram recommendations, BFS allows us a graph essentially into a tree because we know who the children of the parent notice 
# and then the grandchildren and so on and so forth
# BFS adv --> shortest path, closer nodes. disadv --> more memory

# DFS --> Check to see if it exists
# is exactly solving a maze. The idea is to go deep as far as we can. 
# Less Memory, Does path exist ?   --- Can get slow
