# Machine Learning and Data Science

This section contains information about Machine Learning and Data Science with Python

## Intro

 ## - What is Machine Learning ?

It all starts with AI, which simply means a human intelligence exhibited by machines.

- Narrow AI means that machines can be just as 
good or even better than humans at a specific Task
- Example; detecting heart disease from images or at the game of go or even video games.
But Narrow AI that we have currently simply means those machines can only do one thing really well. They cant be like humans and have multiple abilities.

- ML is a subset of AI, ML is an approach to try and achieve AI through systems that can find patterns in a set of data.

- Deep Learning or Deep neural networks is just the one of the techniques for implementing machine learning, it is a type of an algorithm

- Data Science simply means analyzing data, looking at data, and then doing something with it, usually something about business goal.

 ## - How ML works ?
- We are giving all the input and expected output. And with ML the function is generated or created by the machine. Instead of us writing the function, the machine writes the function.
- Function can be replaced with a model.
ML Model
ML Algorithm, bot, Brain etc...
- In order to train this machine, to create this function, we have to give a data. For it to be really good, we have to give it lots and lots of data. And then we want to test to make sure that this data that we give in gives us the correct output.
- ML is simply a computer writing its own function based on the inputs and outputs

 ## - Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised (Classification, Regression)
- Unsupervised (Clustering, Assication Rule Learning)
- Reinforcement (Skill acquisition, Real time Learning)

 ## - ML Steps

- Import the data
- Clean the data
- Split data. Training Set/Test Set
- Create a Model
- Check the output
- Improve

 ## - Tools

- NumPy 
It is a library that helps us to use lists and arrays in Python, and specifically multidimensional arrays
https://numpy.org/

- Pandas 
It is used for what we call data analysis, it gives the idea of data frame, which allows us the functionality to manipulate data in tabular structure rows and columns
https://pandas.pydata.org/

- Scikit Learn 
Creating a model part. Scikit library comes with pre-build algorithms, so we can do classification, regressionsi clustering.
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

- Mathplotlib
It is a charting library, it allows us to visualize data in a nice way.
https://matplotlib.org/

- Jupyter Notebooks
This IDE is useful when we do machine learning or data science because it allows us to step through our code and actually output and keep track of all these we have been doing and also see visualizations.
https://jupyter.org/

- Kaggle
It is a community of machine learning experts where you can do competitions, you can look at other people's Jupyter Notebooks, but most importantly it has data sets.
We have free access to data, to massive amounts of data that are openly accessible.

- Tensorflow
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip


# - What's next?
- Custom models
- Retrainable models
- Pre-trained models

## Installation 

In order to use Selenium,

pip install selenium
