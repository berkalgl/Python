# A trie is specialized tree used in searching most often text
# in most cases, it can outperform binary search trees, hash tables and most other data structures
# trie allows you to know a part of word exists in a text

# with empty root point.

#                          start
#          a           d           n            z
#      r       s      o          e   o            e
#    e                t         w     t            n
#                              s         
# prefix tree
# which proves to be quite efficient in solving these problems,spesific strings, auto completion.
# searching words in a dictionary, search engines, ip addresses etc.
# the benefit of this type of structure is speed and space

# O(length of the word) time complexity
# space complexity, with prefixs we have advantages on memory space.
