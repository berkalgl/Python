#stacks are implemented with arrays and linked lists
# Arrays allow cash locality which makes them technically faster accessing its items in memory 
# because they're right next to each other
# versus linked list that has them scattered all over memory and also linked lists have extra memory associated with them 
# because we have to hold on to those pointers, on the other hand they have more dynamic memory.
# depends on you to choose one.

#QUEUES 
#wait list app

# Arrays have indexes associated with them, so if we had items in queue
# when we remove matt in the queue, we have to reorder indexes and the arrays 
# thats why we dont choose arrays to implement a queue
# using linked list queue and dequeue costs us constant time O(1)
