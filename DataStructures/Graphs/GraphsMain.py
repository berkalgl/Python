# Graph is simply a set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion
# each item called node (vortex), every connection is called an edge
# networks, www, facebook social network, amazon recommodation, google short path for google maps

# Linked list are type of trees, trees are type of graphs

# they can be directed or undirected
# directed are oneway street, undirected you can go and go back
# adding friend on facebook is undirected
# however on twitter or instagram, following a person is directed graph

# weighted and unweighted graph
# weighted graphs contains values in their edges as well
# weighted graphs can help us to find the optimum paths 

# Cyclic and Acyclic graph
# you can go where you started in cyclic graph. every nodes has connection themselves
